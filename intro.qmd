```{r}
1 + 1
```

A `gt` table:

```{r tbl-test, echo = FALSE}
#| results: 'asis'
#| caption: "example caption from chunk option" 
library(gt)
mtcars %>%
  head() %>% 
  gt(caption = "example caption from inside of `gt()` call")
```

In @tbl-test



```{r tbl-test-2, echo = FALSE}
#| results: 'asis'
#| caption: "example caption from chunk option" 
library(gt)
mtcars %>%
  tail() %>% 
  gt()
```
